# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to help clients at the prominent investing bank, Accountability Accounting, in creating a report including the cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market and how they would be grouped to creating a classification system for the new investment. Specifically, the project consisted of four of the following technical analysis parts:

* Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means
* Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results.

The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. In this project, we are going to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
